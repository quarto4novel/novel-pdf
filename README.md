# Novel-pdf Format

Novel-pdf is a quarto template dedicated to fiction writing, expecialy novels.
It's the adaptation of the novel LaTeX class to the quarto markdown syntax. All
the novel/fiction functionality are provided by the novel class, I just wrote
filters and shortcodes around it so that it's easy to write a print-ready
fiction book of professional quality in simple markdown syntax.

[Novel class source](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel.zip)

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template pymaldebaran/novel-pdf
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use
as a starting place for your book.

## Using

```bash
quarto render
```

The resulting pdf should appear as a pdf (PDF-X file) in the `_book` directory.

## Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata,
describe them.

  When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key
  to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I
  grew up. I wrote down ‚Äòhappy‚Äô. They told me I didn‚Äôt understand the
  assignment, and I told them they didn‚Äôt understand life.
  :::
  ```

  or

  ```
  :::{.epigraph by="Robert Frost" from="Nothing Gold Can Stay"}
  | Nature's first green is gold,
  | Her hardest hue to hold.
  | Her early leaf's a flower;
  | But only so an hour.
  :::
  ```
  Available attributes:

  - `lmargin` and `rmargin` to control the left and right margins
  - `lines_before` and `lines_after` to jump a certain amount of lines before
    and after the epigraph
  - `keepindend` to let the paragraphs inside the epigraph have an indend like
    any other paragraphs

  Available metadata:

  - `epigraphs.lmargin` and `epigraphs.rmargin` default values for `lmargin`
    and `rmargin` attributes for the whole document
  - `epigraphs.lines_before` and `epigraphs.lines_after` default values for
    `lines_before` and `lines_after`for the whole document
  - `epigraphs.keepindend` default value for `keepindent` attribute for the
    whole document

- [ ] **raw div formating** and **raw span formating**: classes that can be
  applied to any div or span. ‚ö†Ô∏è ***markdown favors meaning over presentation
  so those classes should not be used directly in your document, prefer the
  semantic classes (see below) that are more suited for clean, meaning centered,
  wrinting.*** ‚ö†Ô∏è

  Here are the available classes and attributes:

  - for divs:
    - [x] `.bold`
    - [x] `.italic`
    - [x] `.strikethrough`
    - [x] `.smallcaps`
    - [x] `.monospace` (with respect to multilign alignment by using right
      alignment instead of default justified one)
    - [x] `.sans`
    - [ ] `.handwritting`
    - [ ] `.sciencefiction`
    - [x] `.noparindent` to remove indentation of the first line of paragraphs
    - [x] `noparskip=value` to set the space between 2 consecutive paragraph
      (in LaTeX units)
    - [x] `vfill=before/after/both`
    - [x] `vspace_before/after/both=length` in LaTeX units (including `\nbs` for
      number of lines). For example `vspace_after=3\nbs` to jump 3 lines after
      the div
    - [x] `lines_before/after/both=nb` in number of lines. Shortcut for vspace
      attribute with value always in number of lines. For example
      `lines_after=3` to jump 3 lines after the div
    - [ ] `font=???`
    - [x] `scale=factor` scale the text by a factor. `scale=1.2` will scale the
      text by x1.2. The resulting paragraphs may finish off-grid (the grid of
      lines that all pages should respect for a good readability) you can
      compensate by adding vertical space after the div using `vspace`
      attribute. The exact vertical space to add is for you to calculate
      See:
      [novel class -- Environment: parascale](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel/doc/novel-documentation.html#h6.1.3)
    - [ ] `lang=???`
    - [x] `margin_left/right/both=length` in LaTeX units. For example
      `margin_left=5em` to add a margin of 5em at the left of the div
    - [x] `align=left/right/centered/justified`
    - [ ] `color` See: https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel/doc/novel-documentation.html#hE.2.2
  - for spans:
    - [x] `.bold`
    - [x] `.italic`
    - [x] `.strikethrough`
    - [x] `.smallcaps`
    - [x] `.monospace`
    - [x] `.sans`
    - [ ] `.handwritting`
    - [ ] `.sciencefiction`
    - [x] `hfill=before/after/both`
    - [ ] `font=???`
    - [x] `scale=factor,hoffset,voffset` scale the text by a factor. Only the
      first parameter is mandatory. `scale=1.2` will scale the text by x1.2. The
      two other parameters are optional and need LaTeX units. Other lines are
      not adjusted so there may be some overlapping.
      See:
      [novel class -- Local sizing: `\charscale`](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel/doc/novel-documentation.html#h6.1.2)
    - [ ] `lang=???`
    - [x] `hspace_before/after/both=length` in LaTeX units. For example
      `hspace_before=2cm` to add a horizontal space of 2cm at the left of the
      span
    - [x] `phantom` Does not print the text, but leaves a horizontal gap as if
      the text were there. Caution: ‚ö†Ô∏è In some locations, this command has
      unexpected results, such as by adding a line.
    - [ ] `first_words/last_words=???` to retrieve the first or last word of a
      span (usefull for title formating)
    - [x] `color` set a color for the text (only in grayscale because of
      printing constraints) the possible values are, in order from dark to
      light: black, gray1, gray2, gray3, gray4, gray5, gray6, gray7, gray8,
      gray9, white. ‚ö†Ô∏è Placing light text over a dark background may produce
      unexpected results in print, even if it looks good in PDF. If you need
      this effect, it is better to build the text into the background, as a
      single image. See:
      [Novel - Color and Opacity](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel/doc/novel-documentation.html#hE.2.2)

- [ ] **semantic div formating** and **semantic span formating**: you can define
  specific classes in the `semantic_classes` metadata and specify which
  **raw formating classes** you want to apply to that class (see this as a
  very simple CSS system). Here is a typical config `_metadata.yml`:

  ```yaml
  semantic_classes:
    greek_lang: [italic, lang=greek]
    robot_speech: [bold, font=sf_futuristic_font]
    shout: [scale=1.5, smallcaps]
    whisper: [scale=0.8]
    hand_written: [scale=1.2, font=my_cursive_font]
  ```

  And here is how to use it in you document:

  ```qmd
  The young boy was afraid but he needed to communicate with his friend so he
  whispered in her ear. [¬´ I think we are doomed. ¬ª]{.whisper} But Valerie was
  not the kind of person to hide when confronted to danger. [¬´ Don't worry
  dude, this monstruous teddy bear is nothing like the pirate I crushed last
  week ! ¬ª]{.shout}.
  ```

- [x] **toc div and spans**: manual table of things (most of the time content
  aka toc but this can be table of anything) with the `tableof` div class and
  `toc_chap`, `toc_part` and `toc_blank` span classes. The page numbering is
  manual for technical reason but also to allow multiple fictionous usage.
- [x] **emptylines shortcode**: add vertical space by a number of lines
- [ ] **foreignlanguage filter**
- [x] Different **rendering mode** adapted to different stage of writing or
  reviewing: printready, cropmarks, shademargins, cropview, closecrop and
  sandbox. They are detailed and documented in `_metadata.yml`.
- [x] **parindent** and **parskip** metadata to specify the default indentation
  and default vertical space between paragraphs.
  See: https://latexref.xyz/fr/_005cparindent-_0026-_005cparskip.html
- [ ] **hyphenation control**
  You can set an "hyphenation cutting point" wherever you want using `\-` even
  in a monospace div or span (useful for url and stuff like that)
  - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Text_Formatting#Hyphenation
  - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Text_Formatting#Margin_misalignment
- [ ] **decoglyph shortcode** See `doc/extras/NovelDeco-glyphs.pdf` in : https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel.zip
- [ ] **chapter deco** See: https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel/doc/novel-documentation.html#h5.1.3.3

## Deprecated features

None at the moment.

## Example

A novel is structured via an `_index.qmd` (you can not use another name for this
file) file that contains an [include shortcodes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/shortcodes.html)
for each chapter.

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [index.qmd](_index.qmd).

The chapters are located in the `chapters` directory, they ca&n be named
whatever you want as long as you reference them correctly in the include
directive in the `_index.qmd` file.

Here are the source code for a three sample chapters:

- [chapters/chap_01.qmd](chapters/chap_01.qmd)
- [chapters/chap_02.qmd](chapters/chap_02.qmd)
- [chapters/chap_03.qmd](chapters/chap_03_basics.qmd)
- and so on

## Inspiration

I took heavy inspiration from the great post about
[quarto extensions](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/quarto-extensions-explainer/index.html).

And for book structure:
