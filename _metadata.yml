## Config specific to novel

# Different rendering mode (you can set only one of them to true !):
# - printready: final PDF-X file ready to be printed even for professionnal.
# - cropmarks: display cuting marks (do not use unless required).
# - draft: Faster rendering time, can cause overflull hbox warning while
#   compiling, ideal fro quick and dirty rendering, the word DRAFT will appear
#   at the upper left of each page.
# - shademargins: Helps to visualize and detect possible layout problems by
#   applying dark gray shade to unsafe areas. This is always a DRAFT rendering.
# - cropview: a narrower view of the document (ignored if Trim Size is same as
#   Media Size). This is always a DRAFT rendering.
# - closecrop: very close view of the document (minimize all possible whitespace
#   around your doc). It's useful to proofread your documents on a portable
#   device (phone, tablet, e-reader). This is NOT an e-book. It does not meet
#   e-book standards, and cannot be changed to meet e-book standards.
# - sandbox: Specific mode designed to produce pages otherwise impossible to
#   render due to LaTeX packages incompatibilities. Doc produced are limited to
#   4 pages. Use this only to produce pages impossible to produce otherwise:
#   with graphics, tables, etc.
#
# It is also possible to set this option just for one render via command line:
#
# quarto render -M special_rendering:draft
#
# Some of these option (cropmarks, cropview) makes only a difference for certain
# trimsize or mediasize.
#
# Those correspond to options of the novel class
# See: https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/luatex/latex/novel/doc/novel-documentation.html#h2

fonts:
  # In novel you do not directly set the main font (also known as roman default).
  # Instead, you set a parent font, from which the main font is derived.
  #
  # Choose only Open Type or TrueType fonts, not the ancient Type 1 (PostScript) or Metafonts.

    # Default main font size is based on other layout settings.
    # Varies from 11pt to 12pt. With all default layouts, value is 11.4pt.
    # Once you have set the Trim Size, margins, and parent font, set the font size

    # should average 60 to 66 characters (including spaces).
